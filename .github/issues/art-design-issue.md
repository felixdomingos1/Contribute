The CubeFlyer game has graphics that are somewhat basic - it is a cube flying through blocks. This can be improved, so those attendees with an art or design background can help make both the UI and the game graphics better.

An a **user interface** team, you have been tasked with:

-   Changing the cube for a different object
-   Improving the look of the columns
-   Making general improvements to the user interface such as color schemes, fonts, or the layout
