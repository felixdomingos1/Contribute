title: Need a pause between hitting an object and being able to restart
labels: bug
---

Not sure if this is a bug report or a feature request.

**To Reproduce**

1. Play the game, tapping space to stay flying
2. Collide with an obstacle just as you tap space to fly
3. The tapping of space just after the game ends quickly restarts the game, not giving you time to realize you hit an object

**Expected behavior**
The game should obviously end and give you time to realize before you restart
