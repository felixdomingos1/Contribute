title: Support Player Scoring
labels: enhancement
---

Add the ability to score in the game. The hud file already supports displaying the score but there isn't any way to actually score anything yet.

Let's find a way to earn points and track that!

Some ideas:

-   Score points the longer you are able to play.
-   Score points when an obstacle is past the player (or created)
-   Add coins that can be picked up to earn points
-   Something else?
